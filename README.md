numeric_precision
==============================

This is a collection of code pieces investigating numeric precision issues in Machine Learning/Deep Learning in Python. Currently, the one and only issue investigated concerns the combination of sigmoid activation and binary crossentropy in classification models; the code accompanies an article published on Towards Data Science in February 2019 (https://towardsdatascience.com/sigmoid-activation-and-binary-crossentropy-a-less-than-perfect-match-b801e130e31).

Generally, Juypter notebooks contain code for illustrations, explanatory prose and some top-level code which calls python files in subdirectory src.
